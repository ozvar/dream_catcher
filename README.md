### Description

dream_catcher is a simple cognitive reframing tool. Use it to keep diary logs of thoughts, intrusive or otherwise, and attempts to reframe them. Answering each text prompt creates a single diary entry and writes it as a row in a markdown table, saved in the local direcotry (diary.md). Records are saved to record.pickle as intermediate step - this should be left alone.

### Usage

Run dream_catcher.py in terminal. I recommend configuring a hotkey that initiates the terminal window and script call in one stroke. I do this in my i3 .config, for instance.
